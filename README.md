# tidal2spotify
Tidal to Spotify favorites migration script. It amazes me this script works. Use with own caution.

## secrets.py
You need to create a secrets.py file and fill in the following information:

```python
tidal_username = ''
tidal_password = ''
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID = ''
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET = ''
```

## Delete Spotify favorite tracks

There's a half working function inside of the script to delete Spotify favorite tracks, uncomment it in main.py
